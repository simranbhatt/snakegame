# snakegame
Help the adorable snake catch and eat the apple! This game was lots of fun to make and modify. To make it more visually satisfying, the code has been revised so that the snake bounces off the "walls" and "ceiling" of the canvas, rather than going through to the other side. However, if you send the snake into the floor, it comes back out through the ceiling. Score and high score displays have also been added, and a reset option has also been added so that the player can restart the game at any time by pressing "R" on the keyboard. The canvas has been made larger to improve the game experience.

Thanks to Steven Lambert (https://github.com/straker) for sharing their original project, which this one is based upon.
